# Calculations 
# 1. Calculate how many small cubes fit in the length of the cuboid-shaped box
small_cubes_in_lenght = length_large_cuboid//side_length_small
#2. Calculate how many small cubes fit in the width of the cuboid-shaped box
small_cubes_in_width = width_large_cuboid//side_length_small
#3. Calculate how many small cubes fit in the height of the cuboid_shaped box
small_cubes_in_height = height_large_cuboid//side_length_small
#4.  Small cubes in the cuboid-shaped box will be the multiplication of small cubes adjusted in the length by small cubes adjusted in the width by small cubes adjusted in the height
num_small_cubes = small_cubes_in_height*small_cubes_in_lenght*small_cubes_in_width
